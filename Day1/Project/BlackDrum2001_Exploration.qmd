```{r}
library(tidyverse)
bd <- read.csv(file.path(getwd(), "Data", "BlackDrum2001.csv"))
head(bd)
```

## Goal: Describe the demographics of the sampled Black Drum from Virginia in 2001

### Start here

Start by plotting the length and age, grouped by month. Here is some code to get you started:

```{r}
bd %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = otoage, y = tl)) + geom_boxplot(aes(group = otoage))
```

Can you improve this plot? 

```{r}
## Insert code here to improve plot above
```

Now add your own code below to explore the biological demographics of the Black Drum sampled in 2001.
