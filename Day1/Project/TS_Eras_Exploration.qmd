```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ts <- read.csv(file.path(getwd(), "Data", "TS_Eras_Tour_Setlist.csv"))
head(ts)
```


## Goal: Create some plots to commmunicate what contributes to the popularity of songs in the setlist

### Start here

Start by plotting the popularity by track name, grouped by album release date. Here is some code to get you started: 

```{r}

ts %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = reorder(track_name, -popularity), y = popularity)) + 
geom_col() +  
facet_wrap(~album_release_date) +
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5))  

```

Can you improve this plot? 

```{r}
## Insert code here to improve plot above
```

Now add your own code below to explore what attributes contribute to a song's popularity.
