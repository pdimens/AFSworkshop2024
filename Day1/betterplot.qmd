## Our original plot

The original plot, taken from the KBeagle preprint (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.22.513369) looks like this:

![KBeagle benchmark figure](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/10/24/2022.10.22.513369/F2.large.jpg?width=800&height=600&carousel=1){fig-align="center"}

Our goal is to reduce the clutter, add color, and emphasize the differences between Beagle and KBeagle, which is the point of this figure all along.

## Let's fudge some data

The actual values aren't super important, so let's make up some approximate values

```{r}
benchmark <- data.frame(
  accuracy = c(seq(0.7, 0.6, by = -0.03), seq(0.9, 0.8, by = -0.03)),
  miss_rate = rep(c(0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2),2),
  software = rep(c("beagle", "kbeagle"), each = 4)
)
benchmark
```

## Let's make a basic plot to mimic the original

```{r}
ggplot(benchmark, aes(x = miss_rate, y = accuracy, fill = software)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  theme_bw()
```

## What if points were better?

We can let the differences between the software at each missing rate be obvious by one being higher than the other.

```{r}
ggplot(benchmark, aes(x = miss_rate, y = accuracy, color = software)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

There's a few things we can do here:

1.  bigger points
2.  draw a pale line between the two points at a given missing rate
3.  remove X axis grid lines
4.  better axis labelling, add title
5.  custom colors
6.  also make the shape of the points different for the two software

### bigger points and shape-by-software

```{r}
ggplot(benchmark, aes(x = miss_rate, y = accuracy, color = software, shape = software)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  theme_bw()
```

### remove X gridlines, Y axis start at 0

```{r}
ggplot(benchmark, aes(x = miss_rate, y = accuracy, color = software, shape = software)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  )
```

### draw a vertical line to show the difference between the two points

```{r}
ggplot(benchmark, aes(x = miss_rate, y = accuracy, color = software, shape = software)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_line(linetype = "longdash", color = "grey70", aes(group = miss_rate)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  )
```

### modify colors to highlight kbeagle and fix labels

```{r}
ggplot(benchmark, aes(x = miss_rate, y = accuracy, color = software, shape = software)) +
  geom_line(linetype = "longdash", color = "grey70", aes(group = miss_rate)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("grey70", "#069460")) +
  xlab("Missing Rate") +
  ylab("Accuracy") +
  labs(title = "Imputation Software Accuracy") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank()
  )
```

### Let's add more data to make facets

```{r}
benchmark2 <- rbind(benchmark, benchmark, benchmark, benchmark)
benchmark2$category <- rep(c("A", "B", "C","D"), each = 8)
benchmark2
```

```{r}
ggplot(benchmark2, aes(x = miss_rate, y = accuracy, color = software, shape = software)) +
  geom_line(linetype = "longdash", color = "grey70", aes(group = miss_rate)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  facet_wrap(vars(category), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("grey70", "#069460")) +
  xlab("Missing Rate") +
  ylab("Accuracy") +
  labs(title = "Imputation Software Accuracy") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
  
```
